# Haddad - Arab Sweets

Welcome to the **Haddad** repository! This project showcases a website **fully designed with the help of Artificial Intelligence**, specifically using the Canvas feature of ChatGPT.

## Purpose

The main goal was to **test the Canvas mode** available in ChatGPT. Through this innovative collaboration, we were able to build and refine the site in real-time, adding sections, tweaking the design, and polishing the functionality more dynamically.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Web Page**: Users can select various Arab sweet products and add them to a shopping cart.
- **Full Purchase Flow**: Displays a summary, generates a QR code for payment, and links to WhatsApp for order confirmation.
- **Dynamic Cart**: Shoppers can manually clear the cart or it can auto-clear once the purchase is confirmed.
- **AI-Powered Design**: Every component—from the HTML structure to the CSS styling and JavaScript logic—was generated and refined with ChatGPT.

## Why ChatGPT Canvas?

ChatGPT Canvas allows us to **iterate on code** within a visual panel, making it easier to:
1. **View real-time changes** without leaving the conversation.
2. **Quickly fix errors**.
3. **Implement design suggestions** directly within ChatGPT.

## Development Process

1. **Initial Requirements & Generation**: We gathered functional requirements and generated base code for `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `app.js`.
2. **Refinement & Iteration**: We adjusted file paths, CSS styles, and shopping cart logic as new ideas or corrections arose.
3. **Adding a Clear Cart Option**: Introduced a button to empty the cart manually, plus automatic clearing after confirming payment.
4. **Local Testing**: We tested changes live via local servers and GitHub repositories.
5. **GitHub Deployment**: The entire project, including this documentation, was pushed to GitHub to demonstrate the **efficiency and agility** that AI-driven collaboration can provide.
